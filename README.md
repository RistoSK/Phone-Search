Create an application to manage people phone numbers and addresses.



The exercise you should implement the following functionality:

1 adding a phone number to the relative person

2 phone number search by person

3 name search by phone number

4 adding an address to the relative person

5 personal information search (search for a person's address and phone number)

6 removing a person's information

7 filtered search by keyword (retrieving a list which must be sorted by name in alphabetic order),
the keyword can appear in the name or address


Some remarks:

In order to make things easier, we assume the name is a single string; if we want to print our lists sorted by surname in alphabetic order
A person can have more than one phone number and address. However, these are not necessarily stored.
If a person is deleted, no search should retrieve them.
